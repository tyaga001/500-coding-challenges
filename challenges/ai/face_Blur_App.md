# Face Blur App

## Type: AI

## Objective

Create an app that uses face detection technology to automatically blur faces in videos, ensuring privacy protection.

## Requirements

### Frontend
- Users can upload videos.
- Users can preview videos with blurred faces.
- Users can download the processed videos.

### Backend
- Handle video uploads and storage.
- Implement face detection and blurring algorithms.
- Provide an API for processing videos.

### AI Component
- Develop or integrate an AI model for real-time face detection in videos.
- Implement blurring techniques to anonymize faces.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for video uploads and previews.
- Efficient and accurate face detection.
- Option to adjust the level of blurring.

## Resources

- [OpenCV Face Detection](https://opencv.org/)
- [MediaPipe Face Detection](https://mediapipe.dev/)
- [Flask REST API](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)

## Example Project Flow

1. **Video Upload**: User uploads a video.
2. **Face Detection**: The AI model detects faces in the video.
3. **Blurring Process**: Faces are blurred according to user preferences.
4. **Download Processed Video**: User previews and downloads the processed video.

## Project Setup

### Frontend

1. Create a new React application.
2. Set up the video upload and preview interface.
3. Implement API calls to the backend.

### Backend

1. Set up a new Flask or Node.js project.
2. Create the necessary API endpoints for video processing.
3. Integrate face detection and blurring algorithms.

### AI Model

1. Use OpenCV or MediaPipe for face detection.
2. Implement blurring techniques to anonymize faces.

## Additional Challenges

- Optimize face detection for speed and accuracy.
- Enhance the user interface for better experience.
- Add support for different video formats.
