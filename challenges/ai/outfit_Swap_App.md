# AI-Powered Outfit Swap App

## Type: AI, Full Stack

## Objective

Create an application that uses AI to match users with others who have similar style preferences but different body types, and suggest outfit swaps.

## Requirements

### Frontend
- Users can create a profile and input their body type and style preferences.
- Users can browse suggested matches and view recommended outfit swaps.
- Users can upload photos of their outfits for the AI to analyze.

### Backend
- Store user profiles, including body type, style preferences, and uploaded outfit photos.
- Implement AI algorithms to analyze style preferences and match users.
- Provide a RESTful API for the frontend to retrieve matched users and outfit recommendations.

### AI Component
- Develop or integrate an AI model that can analyze user-uploaded photos to determine style elements.
- Use machine learning to match users with similar style preferences.
- Ensure the model can differentiate between various body types and suggest appropriate swaps.

### Serverless Database Integration
- Use [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech/) for a serverless database solution.
- Set up a Neon.tech database and connect it to your backend.
- Store user profiles, photos, and AI analysis results in Neon.tech.

## Features

- User authentication and profile management.
- AI-driven style analysis and matching.
- Personalized outfit swap suggestions based on user data.
- Privacy considerations for storing and analyzing user photos.
