# Idea 1: Full Stack AI-Powered Outfit Swap App

## Type: Full Stack, AI

## Objective

Create an application that uses AI to match users with others who have similar style preferences but different body types, and suggest outfit swaps.

## Requirements

### Frontend
- Users can create a profile and input their body type and style preferences.
- Users can browse suggested matches and view recommended outfit swaps.
- Users can upload photos of their outfits for the AI to analyze.

### Backend
- Store user profiles, including body type, style preferences, and uploaded outfit photos.
- Implement AI algorithms to analyze style preferences and match users.
- Provide a RESTful API for the frontend to retrieve matched users and outfit recommendations.

### AI Component
- Develop or integrate an AI model that can analyze user-uploaded photos to determine style elements.
- Use machine learning to match users with similar style preferences.
- Ensure the model can differentiate between various body types and suggest appropriate swaps.

## Features

- User authentication and profile management.
- AI-driven style analysis and matching.
- Personalized outfit swap suggestions based on user data.
- Privacy considerations for storing and analyzing user photos.

## Resources

- [TensorFlow Image Classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification)
- [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Building a RESTful API with Node.js](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/06/rest-api-node-javascript-mongodb/)

## Example Project Flow

1. **User Sign-Up**: A new user signs up and creates a profile, inputting their body type and style preferences.
2. **Photo Upload**: The user uploads photos of their outfits.
3. **AI Analysis**: The AI model analyzes the photos to identify style elements.
4. **Matching Algorithm**: The system finds other users with similar styles but different body types.
5. **Outfit Suggestions**: The user receives suggestions for outfit swaps from matched users.

## Project Setup

### Frontend

1. Create a new React application.
2. Set up user authentication and profile management.
3. Implement the UI for uploading photos and viewing matches.

### Backend

1. Set up a new Node.js or Django project.
2. Create the necessary API endpoints for user management and photo uploads.
3. Integrate the AI model for style analysis and matching.

### AI Model

1. Choose a pre-trained image classification model or train a custom model for style analysis.
2. Implement the matching algorithm to find users with similar styles.

## Additional Challenges

- Improve the AI model's accuracy in recognizing different styles.
- Enhance the matching algorithm to consider additional factors such as color preferences or brand affinities.
- Implement notifications to alert users of new matches or swap suggestions.
